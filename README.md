### About the project
Thanks for your attention. This is the official repository for the paper "Quantum-Inspired Transformer Solver for Pixel-Level Arbitrary-Integer-Scale Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution" (the title has not yet been determined). A pixel-level hyperspectral image super-resolution framework with a quantum-inspired Transformer is proposed in this project. The source code will be available after the paper is accepted.
